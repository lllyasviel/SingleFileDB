# Single File Database (SFDB)

A single file implementation of key-value database for Python 3.

I use this to store millions of image metadata in many machine learning projects. 

It is very useful. 

# Installation

**Just copy the single file "sfdb.py" to any project.**

No installation. No dependencies. 

The one single python file only uses Python 3 standard libraries, *with less than 150 lines of codes.*
